### Visualization Techniques

After writing __clear and meaningful language__ to answer the below questions, please remove the ToDo tags from the questions. Also, be sure to commit your work frequently to GitHub as you work.

* Q1: What does `gsub()` do in this code block? (Hint: use the online help in R using the '?' symbol.)

  * TODO

* Q2: What is shown in Plot 1? (What can you determine?)

  * TODO

* Q3: Plot 2 is a scaled view of the same information from Plot 1. How does Plot 2 provide more information than Plot 1?

  * TODO

* Q4: What does `mutate()` do in this code block?

  * TODO

* Q5: What does `summarise()` do in this code block?

  * TODO

* Q6: Apart from the colors red and blue used to draw the points, what is the main difference between Plot 3a and Plot 3b? For example, is Plot 3b more informative than Plot 3a? Explain.

  * TODO

* Q7: Interpret the results of Plot 4 in terms of the magnitude of the y-axis.

  * TODO

* Q8: In Plot 5, both of the previous plots have been combined together on the same canvas. How does this either help (or confuse) the output of the analysis?

  * TODO

* Q9: What do the whiskers (i.e., the big "I" shaped structures above each histogram bar) convey in this plot? Why might we need to know this information?

  * TODO

* Q10: The word, _function_ is below in the code block. What does this part of the code do? Why do you suppose that it is necessary?

  * TODO

* Q11: Some time is necessary to generate the variable, "ProbeR2". What is taking this code block so long to complete? What is the `lm()` function in R?

  * TODO

* Q12: With the above ideas about R-squared values in mind, which Probe in Plot 8 appears to be able to best explain the model?

  * TODO

* Q13: In Plot 9 we see two curves. What can you infer about the relationships between the Actual cases of relationships and those cases for which no relationship exists? Remember, the blue curve corresponds to the variable `r2` and the red curve corresponds to the Null values.

  * TODO

* Q14: Plot 10 is very important to determine a result concerning the Actual data sets and the Null data sets. Other than showing colored points, what does one conclude from Plot 10 about the above analysis? For example, what non-random event do you determine?
  * TODO

### Questions (Ethics)

In hospitals, doctors use extensive data management systems to record patient information concerning medications, therapies, history, and other details associated with care. This information is encrypted to prevent non-authorized people from accessing it. However, technologies may fail or mistakes may be made to allow the information to be exposed.

In the article by Saira Afzal et al. [2] [Science Direct link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266699002100029X), the authors address "possible ethical concerns" that are consistent with working with patient care technologies. The authors study the integration of information from medical practice and research into technologies which permit sharing between practitioners and patients to determine the existence of ethical challenges associated with anonymity, privacy, informed consent, and security.

* Q15: What was the main objective of this study?
  * TODO

* Q16: How did the authors search for relevant publications?
  * TODO

* Q17: What were the inclusion criteria for the selected studies?
  * TODO

* Q18: Define the following vocabulary in terms of the article.
  * Anonymity
    * TODO

  * Privacy
    * TODO

  * Informed consent
    * TODO

  * Security
    * TODO

* Q19: Why are understanding ethical principles crucial in healthcare provision?
  * TODO

* Q20: Explain why it is important to maintain anonymity for individuals involved in patient-care studies, and discuss potential measures that can be taken to protect their identities.
